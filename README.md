Functional Connectivity (FC) Methods
This package offers a suite of tools for assessing functional connectivity (FC) using both bivariate and multivariate techniques. Designed for neuroscientific data analysis, it can be applied to a range of brain signal modalities but is also adaptable to any dynamical network.

Getting Started
No installation is required. Simply open and run the FC_Methods.ipynb notebook.

Features
The notebook provides the following FC assessment methods, organized by type:

Full Correlation (Corr_func)
Partial Correlation (PCorr_func)
Regularized Inverse Covariance / Precision (Prec_func)
[Magnitude Squared] Coherence (Coh_func)
Mutual Information (MI_func)
Zero-Lag Regression (ZeroLagReg_func)
Pair-Wise Granger Causality (pwGC_func)
Gewekeâ€™s Granger Causality (GGC_func)
[Transfer Function-Based] Coherence (CohTF_func)
Partial Coherence (PCoh_func)
Directed Coherence (DCoh_func)
Partial Directed Coherence (PDCoh_func)
Directed Transfer Function (DTF_func)
Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI)
Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) (not yet tested)
Tutorial
For guidance on using the methods, refer to the FC_Methods_tutorial.ipynb file. Each function also includes a brief description of its parameters for easy customization.

Applications
While initially developed for analyzing FC in brain signals, this package can be used for any dynamic network.
