Functional Connectivity Methods.
The notebook "FC_Methods.ipynb" provides several functional connectivity (FC) assessment measures, utilized in this paper.\\
The methods include:

1. Full Correlation (Corr)
2. Partial Correlation (PCorr)
3. Regularized Inverse Covariance (ICOV) / Precision Matrix (Prec)
4. Coherence (Coh): averaged over frequencies up to a specified limit
5. Mutual Information (MI)
6. Zero-lag/Instantaneous Regression (0-lagReg)
7. Pair-Wise Granger Causality (pwGC)
8. Geweke's Granger Causality (GGC)
9. Directed Transfer Function (DTF): averaged over frequencies up to a specified limit

*Each function includes adjustable parameters for customization.
